Some foods should be avoided because they could cause sickness or safety concerns, while other foods should be avoided because they are unhealthy. Foods to avoid include:  Cow’s milk: Drinking cow’s milk before age 1 may put your baby at risk for intestinal bleeding. Instead of cow’s milk use breast milk or infant formula before age 1. Alternative milks: Alternative milks like soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, oat milk, etc.should not substitute breast milk or formula in the first year. Honey: Honey (even as an ingredient) may cause a serious health problem called botulism. Your child can start to try honey and foods that contain honey only after he or she is 1-year-old.  Sugary drinks: Sugary drinks like fruit juice (even 100% juice), soda, tea/coffee or horchata encourage babies to crave sugary foods and can cause cavities, even before your baby has all of his or her teeth.', 'activities have an effect only on the person who does the action, but a pregnant woman must realize her behavior directly affects the fetus inside her as well. Blood cells are primarily responsible for transporting nutrients, oxygen and potential teratogens from the mother’s placenta to the fetus, via the umbilical cord. There are many harmful substances the mother can ingest or become exposed to that can have negative and harmful effects on the fetus, as well certain vitamins and minerals that can promote prenatal development. The main point of this brochure: PREGNANT WOMEN NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR BODIES! her teeth.','The saying is true that you are eating for both you and your baby. That means the nutrients that you consume are the ones that are going to your fetus. Therefore, it is important to eat foods that will provide nutrition that supports prenatal development. A key finding that supports this notion is the fact that women who overeat tend to birth heavy babies, who then have a higher rate of obesity later in life.', 'Although sleep can be hindered from anxiety and discomfort of the pregnancy, it is vital that you get adequate sleep for both you and your baby. Studies show that little sleep can lead to premature births, low weight births, and an increase in depression, which can have negative effects on your fetus. A lack of sleep can also negatively affect the immune system of the mother, which can then impact the fetus’s development. Overall, make sure you are sleeping a normal amount to keep you sane and your baby healthy.', 'Don’t play music to your fetus if you think he or she will become the next pop star, but do it for the sake of prenatal development. By playing different sounds, your fetus becomes habituated to the rhythm and tone of your language, which can help increase brain development by the increase of neurons created. While how much of what an infant hears in the womb is remembered is debated, it does not hurt to have your fetus experience music prenatally','Relax:While this one may seem obvious, the pressures of pregnancy can often build up without you realizing, negatively impacting your baby’s prenatal development. Stressful hormones can be imprinted onto your baby that can lead to stressful emotions in your child later in life. A study also showed that how anxious a mother is while pregnant is correlated with higher rates of adhd in the child. Therefore, that bubble bath your spouse is pushing you to take might be moresignificant to you, and more importantly your fetus, than you thought.', 'Although it obviously won’t lead to pregnancy, having unprotected sex while pregnant can lead to you contracting STDs. These STDs can then be transmitted to your baby through the placenta. Therefore, make sure to use a condom when having sex while pregnant. You do not want your infant to have to deal with this because of your mistake.', 'Alcohol is the most commonly consumed teratogen, and can cause fetal alcohol syndrome when drunk by a pregnant mother. Many infants with this syndrome have stunted growth and facial features that include a thin upper lip, smoothed philtrum, and a decreased eye width. They often have decreased brain function due to damaged neurons which causes cognitive and behavioral problems']});
