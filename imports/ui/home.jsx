                <h3> Why breastfeeding ?</h3>
            </AccordionItemTitle>
            <AccordionItemBody>
                <p>Exclusive breastfeeding is a cornerstone of child survival and child health because it provides essential, irreplaceable nutrition for a child’s growth and development. Nonetheless, just 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed in the first six months of life globally.
Exclusive breastfeeding – defined as the practice of only giving an infant breast-milk for the first 6 months of life (no other food or water) – has the single largest potential impact on child survival of any preventive intervention. It serves as a child’s first immunization – providing protection from respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, and other potentially life-threatening illnesses. Exclusive breastfeeding also has a protective effect against obesity and certain non-communicable diseases later in life. Yet, much remains to be done to make exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life the norm for infant feeding. Suboptimal breastfeeding practices, including non-exclusive breastfeeding, contribute to 11.6% of childhood deaths, equivalent to roughly 800,000 child deaths annually.
In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed a global breastfeeding target to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life up to at least 50% by 2025.

                <h3>What foods should my baby

avoid?</h3>
            </AccordionItemTitle>
            <AccordionItemBody>
                <p>Before your baby turns 1, there are some foods you should avoid giving him or her.

Some foods should be avoided because they could cause sickness or safety concerns,

while other foods should be avoided because they are unhealthy.

Foods to avoid include:

 Cow’s milk: Drinking cow’s milk before age 1 may put your baby at risk for
intestinal bleeding. Instead of cow’s milk use breast milk or infant formula before
age 1.
Alternative milks: Alternative milks like soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, oat milk,
etc. should not substitute breast milk or formula in the first year.
 Honey: Honey (even as an ingredient) may cause a serious health problem
called botulism. Your child can start to try honey and foods that contain honey
only after he or she is 1-year-old.
 Sugary drinks: Sugary drinks like fruit juice (even 100% juice), soda, tea/coffee
or horchata encourage babies to crave sugary foods and can cause cavities,
even before your baby has all of his or her teeth.
Salty foods: Foods that are high in salt, also known as sodium, should be
avoided because babies’ kidneys can’t handle too much salt. Check food labels
to find foods low in sodium.
Choking hazards: Small, hard foods pose high risks of choking. Common foods
that are most risky include nuts, popcorn, hot dogs and whole grapes. As a tip,
you can cut grapes into small pieces and then serve them to your baby. And just
remember, anything can be a choking hazard so be sure to watch your baby
carefully as he or she eats.
By knowing the foods to avoid, you can keep your baby healthy and safe!</p>

eating foods?</h3>
            </AccordionItemTitle>
            <AccordionItemBody>
                <p>How do you know if your baby is ready for foods other than breast milk or infant
formula? Every baby is different – but you can look for these signs to tell that your baby
is developmentally ready to start trying foods:

 Your baby has good head control. Your baby can keep his or her head in a
steady, upright position.
 Your baby can sit up with little or no support. Your baby needs to be able to
sit upright in a highchair to swallow well.
 Your baby is able to grab objects. Your baby uses his or her hands to grab
and hold onto objects, like a spoon.
 Your baby shows interest in what others are eating. Your baby opens his or
her mouth and leans forward when food is offered.
 Your baby is about 6 months old. At around 6 months of age your baby’s gut
has developed to digest foods other than breast milk or formula.
If your baby can do ALL of these things then he or she is ready to try first foods.</p>
